## Next Steps TODO
This is a very brief list of things that I would love to work (improvement) on given more time:
* Better solution for floating input label, but still sticking with Pure CSS. Not use empty placeholder by default
* Introduce TypeScript
* Make modules css maintenance better, extract out common styling.
* Improve the styling of micro-interactions. Coloring in this case.
* Any edge cases with bugs I haven't found out.
